	<description>A freshly harvested form of the Pholiota fungus, Raw Pholiota shouldn't really be eaten in its natural state, containing concentrated compounds that require further refinement. However, when properly processed, it becomes a key component in enhanced coffee, a stimulant known to boost work speed and movement efficiency. While this weaker variant lacks the full potency of BlackWaterâ€™s original formula, it remains an essential commodity for those seeking an edge in labor-intensive or high-risk environments.</description>
